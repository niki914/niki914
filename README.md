## About Me

Hi, I'm Niki, a Software Engineering student (enrolled in 2023) at Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT). I'm passionate about coding and deeply engaged in Android development. I'm also exploring AI-driven technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), function calling, and prompt engineering. I'm also capable of building complex workflows based on LLMs. My goal is to build innovative mobile applications and intelligent systems with clean, efficient code.

## Technology Stack & Interests

- Languages & Tools: Kotlin, Java, Git, AutoHotkey (AHKv1)
- Android Development: Jetpack, MVP, MVVM and MVI architecture, RESTful APIs
- AI & LLMs: Large Language Models, Function Calling, Prompt Engineering
- Other Skills: Docker, SQLite, KTS

## Development Experience & Current Work

- Building Android apps using Kotlin and Jetpack, focusing on MVI architecture and performance optimization.
- Developing function-calling mechanisms for large language models to enable advanced functionalities in Android development, such as integrating accessibility services and ADB tools to allow the model to control devices.
- Crafting prompt engineering strategies to optimize LLM performance for specific tasks.
- Using AutoHotkey (AHKv1) to automate development workflows and boost productivity.
